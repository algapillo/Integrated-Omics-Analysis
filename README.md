Integrated Omics Analysis using MOVICS
This study aims to integrate multi-omic data from primary and metastatic cutaneous melanoma tumors. Advanced techniques were employed to explore molecular characteristics associated with this disease. The research leverages data provided by the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) platform and bioinformatics tools such as R packages (TCGAbiolinks and MOVICS) for the extraction, download, processing, and analysis of omic data (transcriptomic, methylomic, and proteomic), followed by an integrated analysis. The transcriptomic data expression analysis revealed relevant biological processes and genes implicated in this disease, such as NECTIN-4 and GPX2. Data integration was performed using clustering algorithms, which revealed distinct molecular subtypes in both metastatic and primary tumors. However, this clustering could not be correlated with certain clinical variables, such as the gender of the patients or the disease stage. Future studies could focus on improving clustering precision based on some of the provided clinical variables
